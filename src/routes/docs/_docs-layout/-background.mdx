# Background

## How are we defining an Autocomplete?
Definitions can vary, but for the purposes of this write up
let's define an autocomplete as a component that allows 
users to enter text into an input element to filter down 
the given options in a list. Other similar components might be a 
combobox or a select, which usually have a button instead of an input,
sometimes with a filter input in the listbox itself.

## Why an Autocomplete Component?
Autocompletes are a major force multiplier for our users and provide 
a significant upgrade in user experience compared to a normal combobox. 
Whether it's selecting a small static list value slightly faster or 
helping provide an advanced semantic search experience,
autocomplete components are a powerful tool in our toolkit as developers.

Many libraries offer autocompletes, but oftentimes they are omitted all together
(date pickers too) likely because they are complex to implement and maintain. Most 
are also not headless so come with a lot of baggage.

There are a few libraries out there that offer strong headless options, 
most of which provided inspiration for this project:
- [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/)
- [AriaKit](https://www.ariakit.org/)
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/)

These all have their merits, though none of them are quite what I 
was looking for. I wanted a library that was:
- **Headless**: I wanted to be able to use my own components and styles.
- **Accessible**: I wanted to be able to use the components without worrying about 
  accessibility issues.
- **Asynchronous**: I wanted to be able to easily use the components with 
  asynchronous data sources, not as an after thought or with painful overhead.
- **TypeScript**: Typescript should be a first-class citizen.

## How It Works
In addition to the components above, the Wispe autocomplete
 component is built with heavy inspiration from [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest/docs/overview),
 and the composability it brings to a complex component. Just like TanStack Table,
 the Wispe Autocomplete is built with a core hook that takes in all the information that it needs,
 and exposes properties and methods that can be composed into a component that 
suits your specific needs.
